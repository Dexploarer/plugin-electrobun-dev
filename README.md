# plugin-electrobun-dev

A [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) plugin for building Electrobun desktop apps — from first `electrobun init` through production release.

Electrobun is a cross-platform desktop framework (macOS/Windows/Linux) that uses Bun as runtime and a native system webview (or CEF) as renderer.

## What's Inside

### 15 Skills

| `electrobun-build` | Build system, code signing, CI/CD matrix for all 5 platforms |
| `electrobun-release` | Auto-update configuration, Updater API, artifact publishing |
| `electrobun-webgpu` | Native GPU rendering, WGSL shaders, Dawn/WGPU buffer management |
| `electrobun-testing` | `defineTest()` framework, Kitchen Sink test patterns |
| `electrobun-kitchen-sink` | Kitchen Sink reference app, UI map, test automation |
| `electrobun-sdlc` | Full 8-stage SDLC pipeline overview and stage handoffs |
| `electrobun-teams` | Agent Teams orchestration (`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`) |
| `electrobun-milady` | milady-ai/milady integration — trust scoring, agent review, milady CI secrets |
| `electrobun-guide` | Master index — decision tree, full inventory, when-to-use reference |

### 13 Commands

Slash commands invoked as `/electrobun-<name>`.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/electrobun-init` | Interactive template picker (19 templates) → scaffolds new project |
| `/electrobun-setup` | Run after init — creates CI/CD, tests, docs, CLAUDE.md, optional AI review + trust scoring |
| `/electrobun-workflow` | Shows pipeline stage, what's done, what's next |
| `/electrobun-feature <desc>` | Quick 2-agent build: UI agent → RPC Contract Handoff → backend agent |
| `/electrobun-sdlc <desc>` | Full 8-stage pipeline: researcher → architect → planner → dev squad → QA → tests → alignment → docs |
| `/electrobun-rpc` | RPC setup wizard: schema authoring, handler wiring, shared type file |
| `/electrobun-window` | Window creation wizard: BrowserWindow options, sizing, positioning, title bar |
| `/electrobun-menu` | Application menu / context menu / tray menu builder |
| `/electrobun-wgpu` | WebGPU feature builder: shader setup, render loop, buffer management |
| `/electrobun-test` | 5-option menu: run by name, run all, write new test, manifest ops, coverage |
| `/electrobun-align` | Alignment wizard: scans repo, backs up files, prompts per change, repairs drift |
| `/electrobun-build` | Guided build: env picker, signing prereqs, version confirm, artifact summary |
| `/electrobun-release` | Full release: version bump, signing check, channel select, build, upload, verify |

### 11 Agents

Agents are dispatched by commands or orchestrators.

**SDLC Pipeline (Stages 1–8)**

| Stage | Agent | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | `electrobun-researcher` | Codebase scan, API surface mapping, risk identification |
| 2 | `electrobun-architect` | Architecture spec, blast radius analysis, RPC flow, config skeleton |
| 3 | `electrobun-planner` | Atomic TDD task plans, agent assignments, sanity checks |
| 4a | `electrobun-ui-agent` | Renderer files, HTML/CSS, Electroview RPC, produces RPC Contract Handoff |
| 4b | `electrobun-backend-agent` | Bun-side wiring, BrowserView.defineRPC, config updates |
| 5 | `electrobun-qa-engineer` | Spec compliance audit, blast radius check, BLOCKER/IMPORTANT/MINOR report |
| 6 | `electrobun-test-writer` | Golden-outcome tests (Kitchen Sink defineTest or vitest) |
| 7 | `electrobun-alignment-agent` | Fix QA findings in priority order, cleanup, blast radius correction |
| 8 | `electrobun-docs-agent` | Mintlify docs, regression tests, mark plan COMPLETE |

**Specialist Agents**

| Agent | Use When |
|-------|---------|
| `electrobun-debugger` | Something is broken — build failure, RPC timeout, blank window, GPU crash |
| `electrobun-kitchen-agent` | Automating Kitchen Sink tests, reading UI map, running test suites |

## Quick Start

```
What do I want to do?
│
├─ Start a brand-new Electrobun app
│    └─ /electrobun-init → then /electrobun-setup
│
├─ Build a complete new feature (with tests + docs)
│    └─ /electrobun-sdlc <feature description>
│
├─ Add a quick feature to an existing view
│    └─ /electrobun-feature <description>
│
├─ Wire up RPC between bun and renderer
│    └─ /electrobun-rpc
│
├─ Build and package the app
│    └─ /electrobun-build
│
├─ Publish a release
│    └─ /electrobun-release
│
├─ Something is broken
│    └─ electrobun-debugger agent
│
└─ Align an existing project with plugin standards
     └─ /electrobun-align
```

## Installation

```bash
claude plugins marketplace add Dexploarer/plugin-electrobun-dev
claude plugins install electrobun-dev@plugin-electrobun-dev
```

Restart Claude Code. The plugin's skills, commands, and agents will be available immediately.

To update later:

```bash
claude plugins update electrobun-dev@plugin-electrobun-dev
```

    /electrobun-sdlc       → Full feature (8-stage pipeline)
    /electrobun-rpc        → Wire RPC
    /electrobun-window     → Add window
    /electrobun-menu       → Add menus
    /electrobun-wgpu       → Add GPU rendering

QUALITY
    /electrobun-test       → Run/write tests
    /electrobun-align      → Repair drift

BUILD & RELEASE
    /electrobun-build      → Package for distribution
    /electrobun-release    → Publish + update server

STATUS CHECK
    /electrobun-workflow   → Where am I in the pipeline?
```

## milady Integration

This plugin is built to work with the [milady-ai/milady](https://github.com/milady-ai/milady) agents-only contribution model. The `electrobun-milady` skill covers:

- Trust scoring tiers and how to build trust efficiently
- milady-specific CI secret names (different from standard Electrobun names)
- Agent review pipeline — machine-parsed verdict format, follow-up issue auto-creation
- Per-stage SDLC adjustments for milady-targeted development (Biome, no `any`, 500 LOC limit, coverage thresholds)
